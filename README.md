# ðŸ“Š Scale Jupyter Notebooks Dynamically with Kafka & KEDA

This project demonstrates how to **dynamically scale Kubernetes deployments** (specifically Jupyter notebooks) using **Kafka metrics** and **KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaler)**.

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** or copy the scripts into your working directory.

2. **Install Python dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip3 install pyyaml jinja2
   ```

3. **Run the main script:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **During execution:**
   - If not connected to a Kubernetes cluster, you will be prompted for your `kubeconfig` file path.
   - The script performs the following tasks:
     - Sets up **KEDA** in the `keda` namespace
     - Deploys a **Jupyter notebook** as a `Deployment` and `Service`
     - Creates a **KEDA ScaledObject** to scale based on **Kafka lag**
     - Verifies the health of the deployment

### âœ… KEDA detected Kafka lag and scaled the `jupyter-notebook` deployment:
